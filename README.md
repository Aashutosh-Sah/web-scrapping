Wikipedia Scraping
This project demonstrates how to scrape data from Wikipedia using Python and its popular libraries. Wikipedia provides a large amount of data across various articles that can be extracted programmatically to analyze or build applications. Web scraping allows us to collect this data efficiently.

# Prerequisites
Before running the scraping script, you need to ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python: Python 3.6 or higher is recommended.
Libraries:
  requests: For sending HTTP requests to the Wikipedia server.
  BeautifulSoup4: For parsing the HTML content and extracting data.
  pandas (optional): For organizing the scraped data into a tabular format.
  wikipedia-api (optional): A Python wrapper for interacting with the Wikipedia API.


You can install the required libraries using pip:
> pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas wikipedia-api

How to Use
1. Scrape Wikipedia Articles
The main script scraper.py is responsible for scraping data from Wikipedia articles. Here's how to use it:

1 . Clone the repository:
>
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Wikipedia-Scraping.git
cd Wikipedia-Scraping

2 . Run the scraper:
python scraper.py "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)"

2. Modify the Script for Other Articles
To scrape other articles, simply modify the URL in the scraper.py script or pass a different Wikipedia page URL when calling the script.

For example:
python scraper.py "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning"
3. Save Data in Tabular Format (Optional)
If you'd like to store scraped data in a CSV file for easier analysis, you can modify scraper.py to use pandas. You can scrape specific data points such as:

Titles
Sections or headings
Links
Content sections
Example of saving headings and content sections to a CSV:
  import pandas as pd

data = {
    'Heading': headings,
    'Content': content,
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
df.to_csv('output/scraped_data.csv', index=False)

# Important Notes
Respect Wikipedia's Terms of Service: Wikipedia's terms of use prohibit scraping in ways that violate its guidelines. Always ensure you're scraping responsibly and don't overload their servers with frequent or large requests. Consider using Wikipedia's API for large-scale scraping, as it is designed for such tasks.

Rate Limiting: Be mindful of the rate at which you're sending requests. Use time.sleep() to introduce delays between requests to avoid overwhelming the server.

Legal and Ethical Considerations: Make sure you're complying with applicable laws and Wikipedia's guidelines when scraping or using the data.

Conclusion
This project provides a starting point for scraping Wikipedia data for analysis, research, or educational purposes. Customize the script as necessary to scrape specific data fields and store them in your preferred format.
